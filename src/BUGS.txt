1 -> mouse release bug: if in INSERT_LINE_MODE and then instead of add a new line, user choose other item on scene -> crash

2 -> when run demo and choose a video, the dialog doesn't close

3 -> click on instruction rule text -> crash

4 -> the order of container and event in a rule is not configurable
  -> work around, create multiple containers in order ("one_event" type for 1 event)
  
5 -> after load rule data, delete some item from RuleTree cause crash....
6 -> load recursive container is not correct
7 -> when object enter_area or crossing_tripwire, the event keep trigger in one context
      can cause multiple event (but only count as one event)
